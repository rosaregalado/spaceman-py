Import the "random" module

Create a function to randomly selects and loads the secret word from a list
  open words text file  
  create a variable to store all lines in the file as list objects
  close the open file

  split the list of objects using an empty space
  create a variable and use the random module to choose the "secret word"
  return the secret word


Create a function to check if all the letters of the secret word have been guessed
  create an variable and set to true
  create a "for in" loop to check for letters in secret word(string)
    write an "if not in" statement to check if the letter is not in the guessed letters(list of strings)
    if the statement is true, set the variable to false
    break loop
  return variable


Create a function to get a string displaying the letters guessed(input) so far   
  create a local variable and store an empty string
  create a "for in" loop to check for letters(chars) in secret word
    write an "if in" statement to check if the letter is in the guessed letters(list of strings)
      if the statement is true, add the letter to the empty string variable
    else,
      if the statement is not true, add an underscore to the empty string variable
  return the empty string variable


Create a function to check if the letter guessed(input) is in the secret word(string)
  write an "if in" statement to check if the letter guessed(input) is in the secret word(string)
    if the statement is true, return true
  else,
    the statement is false, return false


Create a function that controls the spaceman game, which uses a secret word(string) as argument
  create a local variable with an empty array, will be used for storing letter strings
  create a variable to count the amount of guesses left, set equal to 7
  create a variable to keep the program running, set to true

  display a welcome statement for the user
  display a statement with the length of the secret word(string)
  display a statement instructing the user with the amount of incorrect guesses they get 

  create a "while" loop that keeps the program running 
    prompt the user to "input" a letter to guess the secret word
    create a "while" loop to check that the user only inputs one letter
      display a message saying "only one letter"
      prompt the user to input the letter again

    write an "if" statement calling the helper function that checks if the input letter is in the secret word
      display a message saying "your guess appears in the word"
      append the input letter to the local variable array
    else,
      display a message saying "guess again"
      decrement "guesses" by one
      display a message stating number of guesses remaining

    display the guessed word so far by calling the helper function "get guessed word"

    write an "if" statement calling the function "is word guessed" to check for win or lose
      display a message saying the user wins
      set running variable to false to end loop(game ends)
    else,
      write an "if" statement to check if user has reached 0 remaining guesses
        display a message saying the user loses
        display the secret word for the user
        set the running variable to false to end loop(game ends)
